Java Inheritance Types :
Below are the different types of inheritance which are supported by Java.

1. Single Inheritance : In single inheritance, a sub-class is derived from only one super class. It inherits the properties and behavior of a single-parent class. Sometimes, it is also known as simple inheritance. 

2. Multilevel Inheritance : In Multilevel Inheritance, a derived class will be inheriting a base class, and as well as the derived class also acts as the base class for other classes. 

3. Hierarchical Inheritance : In Hierarchical Inheritance, one class serves as a superclass (base class) for more than one subclass. In the below image, class A serves as a base class for the derived classes B, C, and D.


4. Multiple Inheritance : In Multiple inheritances, one class can have more than one superclass and inherit features from all parent classes. Please note that Java does not support multiple inheritances with classes. In Java, we can achieve multiple inheritances only through Interfaces.

5. Hybrid Inheritance : It is a mix of two or more of the above types of inheritance. Since Java doesnâ€™t support multiple inheritances with classes, hybrid inheritance involving multiple inheritance is also not possible with classes. In Java, we can achieve hybrid inheritance only through Interfaces if we want to involve multiple inheritance to implement Hybrid inheritance.
